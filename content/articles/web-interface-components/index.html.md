Before I boldly pronounce some things, let me introduce myself in a couple of words. For more than four years (sic!) I'm
designing [Yandex](https://yandex.com/) search results page. Sure, I'm not doint it alone. For a number of times I had
built it from scratch, binded to real data, opened on cheapest Android phones, showed to people, threw it away and
started from very beginning. This I had already [published
*(ru)*](http://www.lookatme.ru/mag/blogs/design-school/215901-design-school-search). It sounds like I'm bragging, but I
know about little trust to an unknown author.

I decided not to care if anyone reads my text to the end and what the readers will think; however, I understand that
there will be not very much of those. What I really care about and what disturbs me is that for years I could not
discuss the topis with anyone, due to different reasons. This is why this text is so obscenetly long, very detailed,
 many times getting episodic. Also it has pieces of code, quotes of
 [Shchedrovitsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgy_Shchedrovitsky), my drafts of interfaces, something about
 linguistic determinism and contempt towards the dogmas fundamental for the modern industry web development, which
 is pretending at every conference how awesome everything is (well, I have already began).

hyperlinks. It was possible to become an HTML developer in a week; everyone managed to find there niche. People were
happy to the fact that their web just works. high pain
